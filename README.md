## Features

- **Multi-Channel Notifications**: Get stock alerts via console, Telegram, NTFY, Home Assistant, and Discord.
- **Quick Configuration Tool**: Use 'stockconfig.py' to easily set up monitoring for specific cards and locales.
- **Automatic SKU Detection**: The script tracks changes on the API, which avoids the script missing stock due to a wrong configuration.
- **Sound Alerts**: Plays a notification sound when stock is detected (Windows and macOS supported).
- **Browser Auto Opening**: Automatically opens the product page in your browser when stock is detected (see ‚ö†Ô∏èIMPORTANT BROWSER AUTO OPEN NOTICE‚ö†Ô∏è below).
- **Periodic Status Updates**: Provides periodic status updates via configured notification channels.
- **Ad-hoc Status Updates (TELEGRAM ONLY)**: Use the `/status` command in Telegram to get the current status of the stock checker.
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and graceful shutdown capabilities.
- **Critical Mobile Alerts (HOME ASSISTANT ONLY)**: Leverage Home Assistant's power notification support on iOS/Android, to ensure that you never miss a stock alert.

---

## Automatic Product Information Updates

The script periodically checks NVIDIA's API to ensure that it's tracking the correct products. It can detect both:
- **Name Changes**: When a product's display name changes but the SKU remains the same.
- **SKU Changes**: When a product's SKU changes but the display name remains the same.

When changes are detected, the script automatically updates its internal tracking and notifies you about these changes.

---

## Notification Support

### Telegram Notifications

When stock changes are detected, the script sends a Telegram message like this:

```
üîî NVIDIA Stock Alert
‚úÖ IN STOCK: GeForce RTX 5090
üí∞ Price: ¬£1,939.00
üîó Link: https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/50-series/rtx-5090/
```

Telegram Commands:
- **`/status`**: Get the current status of the stock checker, including uptime, # of API requests, and the cards being monitored.
- Follow this guide (https://docs.tracardi.com/qa/how_can_i_get_telegram_bot/) to get your bot setup. Add the token and chat ID's into config.py.

### NTFY Notifications

When stock changes are detected, the script sends a NTFY message to your configured topic with similar information to the Telegram message.

### Home Assistant Notifications

The script can send notifications to your Home Assistant instance, including critical alerts that can override Do Not Disturb settings on your device. 

Critical alerts can be configured in the `HOMEASSISTANT_CONFIG` section of your `config.py` file. Be advised, THIS WILL DISREGARD 'DO NOT DISTURB' SETTINGS ON YOUR DEVICE.
```python
    "critical_alerts_enabled": True,  # Set to True to enable critical alerts
    "critical_alerts_volume": 1.0     # Volume level for critical alerts (0.0 to 1.0)
```
Note - Critical Alerts will only work for "IN STOCK" alerts. Run the script with the `--test` arg to ensure this is setup properly.

### Discord Notifications

Stock alerts and status updates can be sent to a Discord channel via webhooks.

### Sound Notifications

- On **Windows**: Plays a system alert sound.
- On **macOS**: Plays the "Ping" sound.
- On **Linux**: Sound notifications are not supported.

### Browser Automation

If enabled, the script will automatically open the product page in your default browser when stock is detected. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Please refer to the "IMPORTANT BROWSER AUTO OPEN NOTICE" section above before using this feature, especially if you're also using remote notification services.

##  ‚ö†Ô∏èIMPORTANT BROWSER AUTO OPEN NOTICE‚ö†Ô∏è

*Note 1*

This script was built with the understanding that the links provided to you are uniquely generated. Until this can be confirmed otherwise, you should be very careful about using BOTH the auto browser open feature and remote notifications at the same time.

"Why?" I hear you ask - well if the link is unique, if it has automatically opened in your browser, then it's probably not going to work for you if you open it from Telegram or another notification service on another device.

So, if your main use case is that you want to open the link from a notification service (you might not be at the machine running the script when the stock ping arrives), then DISABLE the auto browser open in config.py:

`"open_browser": False,`

*Note 2*

If you have the browser auto-open enabled, it's strongly recommended to run the script with the "--test" arg at least once. This will let you test to see if the browser opens correctly (it uses your default OS browser).

---

## Usage

### Running the Script

<!-- Before you start monitoring for stock, you need to run the configuration tool to set up your locale and product preferences:

```bash
python stockconfig.py
```

Then run the stock checker: -->

```bash
python 50check.py
```
